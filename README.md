## Working of the code
1. The code base is basically divided into three files : `lib\main.dart` , `lib\HomePage.dart` and `lib\FireStoreHelper.dart`.
2. The `lib\main.dart` file calls the *MyApp* Class which in turn calls the *MyHomePage* class in the `lib\HomePage.dart`.
3. The `lib\HomePage.dart` file consists of all the widgets which when added together forms the basic UI of the application. It provides functions to implement **swipe navigation** to browse through images, **Downloading Images** and **Sharing the image link** features. It also consits of a expandable text box which consists of text related/describing the respective image.
5. The `lib\FireStoreHelper.dart` file consists of helper functions which helps the application to communicate with the Firebase (Server) to retrieve images and text.
